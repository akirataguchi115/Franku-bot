# Papa Franku - The Discord bot for HABBO

Papa Franku is the world's first Discord bot using the HABBBO API.
Feel free to fork the project. It should run smoothly on Windows and UNIX with the instructions below.

##How to deploy
The project requires [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request). To install these just run `npm install discord.js` and `npm install request` in the project folder. After that just start the bot server with the command `node bot.js`.
